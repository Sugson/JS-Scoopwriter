/*

  Customisations added after upgrading to bootstrap 3

  This change invalidated a lot of classes, thus probably many of the
  other files could (and hopefully would) be eliminated in the
  future. I collect here the needed overrides on the bootstrap 3
  classes, hopefully this file will be renamed and remain as the only
  customisation file for the editor, together with a bootstrap theme.
